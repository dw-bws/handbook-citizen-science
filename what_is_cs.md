# What is Citizen Science

* The term citizen science was coined by **Alan Irwin** and **Rick Bonney** independently of each other 
* Both used the term but give it different meanings. 

## Alan Irwin (Irwin 1995)
* Citizen science is a way for democratizing science, which he regards as elitist
* Science seen as obligation to take care of the needs of people (= citizens)
* Therefore, citizens should create knowledge independently and bring practical and local knowledge into the traditionally oriented scientific community through their external perspective

## Rick Bonney (Bonney et al. 2016)
* Democratizing science is not primary goal 
* Citizen scientists are just data collectors 
* Hopes to create the largest possible community of voluntary laypersons with an interest in science who contribute to scientific projects as data collectors
* Approach is closely related to the concept of “crowdsourcing” (Eitzel et al. 2017; Woolley et al. 2016).
