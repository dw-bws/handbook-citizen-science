# Standards for automated Data Collection
  
Generally speaking, a standard is something established by an authority, a custom, or by general consent as a model or as an example.
Standards in computer science define conventions and procedures by broadly recognized bodies (e.g. standards organizations). They exist for operating systems, programming languages, data formats, communications protocols and electronic interfaces<sup>1</sup>. Standards help to build solutions (e.g. software) that works on different computers. They are usually available as printed or electronic public documents in the internet or libraries.<p>

## OGC
The abbreviation OGC stands for Open Geospatial Consortium. It is a international voluntary standards organization, formed in 1994. In the OGC more than 500 members are working together on a consensus process for the development and implementation of open standards for geospatial data and services.
