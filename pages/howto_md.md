At the Github pages overview site, there are:  
1. One file “index.md”
- this file works as the home page,  
- when users are calling the external link, they call this file  
-
2. Two folders:  

- “images”
  - This folder contains all images used at the pages, stored in the folder “pages”.  
  
- "pages"  
  - This folder contains all pages with the content.
  - All files have the extension “.md”
