# Annotation  and  control  for  Citizen  Science  in‐situ data collection 

## Guidelines  

<p align="justify">There are no international binding standards for collecting data using citizen science. Nevertheless, a large number of guidelines and best practice strategies exist The  European  Citizen  Science  Association  compiled  an  overview  of  such  Citizen Science guidelines and publications with links to the documents: https://ecsa.citizen‐science.net/blog/collection‐citizen‐science‐guidelines‐and‐publications </p>      

The general layout of a citizen science project can be classified into three categories:

<p align="justify">One  the  one  side,  there  are  solely  contributory  projects,  which  are  planned  and designed  by  scientists  without  involving  citizen  scientists.  Here,  citizens  are  less involved and is more focused on the scientists needs. Many authors emphasize the importance  of  enthusiasm  among  citizen  scientists  for  the  subject,  which  helps  to capture the imagination of a broad audience. This will be difficult, with contributory projects. Projects that may gain more attention in the public and attract a committed team  of  citizen  scientists  are  collaborative  and  co‐created  projects.  Collaborative projects  are  also  initiated  and  designed  by  scientist  but  involve  citizens  in  several stages of the project design, execution, analysis and dissemination. Co‐created projects merge from an interested community of non‐experts, which is approach science with a task or question that could be resolved in a joint effort (Bonney et al. 2009b, Tweddle et al. 2012).</p>
