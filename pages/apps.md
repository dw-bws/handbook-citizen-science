## KoBo Toolbox

<p align="justify">The  KoBo  Toolbox  is  a  collection  of  tools  for  field  data  collection  and  consist  of  a website (https://www.kobotoolbox.org), a server for data exchange and an Android app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.koboc.collect.android) for mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. It is an open-source initiative (https://github.com/kobotoolbox) and works on- and offline. For data transfer, SSL encryption is used. The basic procedure to use KoBo Toolbox for data collection consist of four basic steps:<p>  
  
1. Design of a form at the KoBo website  
2. Download empty form from KoBo server to mobile device running the KoBo Collet app  
3. Fill the form with measurement data in the field  
4. Upload filled forms to the KoBo server when data collection is finished and a internet connection is available

<p align="justify">Later, the KoBo website offers some tools for statistical data analysis. The collected data  can  also  be  downloaded  on  various  formats  for  analysis  with  other  tools  like spreadsheet software packages of scripts written in different programming languages (e.g. R, Python, IDL, Matlab).  
To use Kobo Toolbox, a user account is required. Every interested person may register free of charge. During the registration process, a login and password has to be specified. The login will later be used to address and access a section at the KoBo toolbox server that is reserved for the registered user.  
Once a user account has been set up, the first step is the design of a form for later offline data collection in the field. Forms are created at the KoBo website. A form consists of different questions. After naming the question (e.g. Plant Height, see also Fig. 4), the question type has to be selected (Fig. 5). An overview of all possible question types and their meaning can be found in the table in Fig. 6. </p>
