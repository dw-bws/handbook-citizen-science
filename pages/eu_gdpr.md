# EU General Data Protection Regulation

We can collect data about almost everything, also about human beings. Personal data are subject to special protection and different legal regimes. The International Data Group (IDC), a Market research and consulting company in the field of information technology and telecommunications, projects an increase of data
volume in the so-called global datasphere to 163 zettabytes (ZB). One ZB is 1021 bytes (one sextillion [in German: eine Trilliarde]) (Reinsel et al. 2017). This will result in an
revenue of about 88.5 Billion US-Dollars in 2025 (Finos 2016). A large proportion of these data will be personal data. For enterprises, the value of these data lies in being able to offer tailor-made services, goods and also advertising, or to offer completely new business models based on such data. Under these circumstances, it is becoming increasingly difficult to control one's own data and will putting pressure on personal data protection politics (Egberts et al. 2018).

<p align="justify">Data collected by citizens or citizen scientists can either be collected analogously in a pre-printed form or digitally using a smartphone app and contains at least:</p> 

1.  a spatial reference, i.e. Location coordinates (e.g. longitude and latitude),  
2.  a temporal reference, i.e. the date and time of the measurement  
3.  at least one datum (singular of data) which is:  
    a.  nominally scaled (e.g. plant species)  
    b.  ordinally scaled (naturally distinguishable characteristics like “very good”, “good”, etc.)  
    c.  metrically scaled (e.g. air temperature in C° or plant height in cm)    
4.  a **personal reference**, which is always given in the case of digital data acquisition using a smartphone app, but may or may not exist in the case of analog data acquisition  

To establish a common and equivalent level of personal data protection for all member states of the European Union, the **General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR)** has been introduced. The EU-GDPR only applies to natural persons; regulations on data on legal persons is explicitly omitted. Thus, aim of the EU-GDPR is not to protect the "ownership of data", but the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in the EU. The law can also be seen as a means of protection of basic rights, as it aims to ensure the free development of one's own personality.  
The EU GDPR came into force on 25th May 2018. Since then, the “Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC “(= EU General Data Protection Regulation, in short EU GDPR) applies to all member states of the European Union https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e1374-1-1).  

An essential part of the EU GDPR is the protection of so-called "personal data", which are defined in Article 4 as follows:  

*“personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;*  

According to the EU GDPR, the collection or processing of personal data is only lawful on the basis of a statutory authorisation. According to Article 6, a statutory authorisation is given if:  
<ol>
    <li> a.	the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;</li>
    <li>b.	processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;</li>  
    (c)	processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;  
    (d)	processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;  
(e)	processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;  
(f)	processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.  
•	Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.	
</ol>
To go back to the first case of authorisation to see what consent given by a natural person means in the terms of the EU-GDPR means “a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement”. This also includes “ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data” Furthermore, Recital 32 demands that the reasons for a data processing are clearly stated and that the it is possible to withdraw a once given consent and that this possibility is clearly explained (Recital 32 of the EU-GDPR https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/legal-grounds-processing-data/grounds-processing/when-consent-valid_en).
