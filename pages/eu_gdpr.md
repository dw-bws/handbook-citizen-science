# EU General Data Protection Regulation

We can collect data about almost everything, also about human beings. Personal data are subject to special protection and different legal regimes. The International Data Group (IDC), a Market research and consulting company in the field of information technology and telecommunications, projects an increase of data
volume in the so-called global datasphere to 163 zettabytes (ZB). One ZB is 1021 bytes (one sextillion [in German: eine Trilliarde]) (Reinsel et al. 2017). This will result in an
revenue of about 88.5 Billion US-Dollars in 2025 (Finos 2016). A large proportion of these data will be personal data. For enterprises, the value of these data lies in being able to offer tailor-made services, goods and also advertising, or to offer completely new business models based on such data. Under these circumstances, it is becoming increasingly difficult to control one's own data and will putting pressure on personal data protection politics (Egberts et al. 2018).

<p align="justify">Data collected by citizens or citizen scientists can either be collected analogously in a pre-printed form or digitally using a smartphone app and contains at least:</p> 

1.  a spatial reference, i.e. Location coordinates (e.g. longitude and latitude),  
2.  a temporal reference, i.e. the date and time of the measurement  
3.  at least one datum (singular of data) which is:  
    a.  nominally scaled (e.g. plant species)  
    b.  ordinally scaled (naturally distinguishable characteristics like “very good”, “good”, etc.)  
    c.  metrically scaled (e.g. air temperature in C° or plant height in cm)    
4.  a **personal reference**, which is always given in the case of digital data acquisition using a smartphone app, but may or may not exist in the case of analog data acquisition
