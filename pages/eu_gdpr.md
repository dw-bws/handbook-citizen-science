# EU General Data Protection Regulation

<p align="justify">In recent years, the concept of citizen science has gained more and more currency and acceptance in both civil society and the scientific community. The term citizen science itself, however, is older and, with Alan Irwin and Rick Bonney, has independent authors who both use the term but give it different meanings. For Alan Irwin citizen science is rather a means of democratizing science, which is regarded as elitist, and sees science as an obligation to take care of the needs of people (= citizens). Therefore, citizens should create knowledge independently and bring practical and local knowledge into the traditionally oriented scientific community through their external perspective (Irwin 1995). Bonney et al. (2016) on the other hand, sees citizen scientists as data collectors and does not primarily aim to democratize science, but hopes to create the largest possible community of voluntary laypersons with an interest in science who contribute to scientific projects as data collectors. This approach is closely related to the concept of “crowdsourcing” (Eitzel et al. 2017; Woolley et al. 2016).</p>

<p align="justify">Data collected by citizens or citizen scientists can either be collected analogously in a pre-printed form or digitally using a smartphone app and contains at least:</p> 
1. a spatial reference, i.e. Location coordinates (e.g. longitude and latitude), 
2. a temporal reference, i.e. the date and time of the measurement
3. at least one datum (singular of data) which is:
a. nominally scaled (e.g. plant species)
b. ordinally scaled (naturally distinguishable characteristics like “very good”, “good”, etc.)
c. metrically scaled (e.g. air temperature in C° or plant height in cm)
4. a personal reference, which is always given in the case of digital data acquisition using a smartphone app, but may or may not exist in the case of analog data acquisition
