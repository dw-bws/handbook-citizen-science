# What is Citizen Science

* The term citizen science was coined by Alan Irwin and Rick Bonney independently of each other 
* Both used the term but give it different meanings. 

## Alan Irwin (Irwin 1995)
* Citizen science is a way for democratizing science, which he regards as elitist
* Science seen as obligation to take care of the needs of people (= citizens)
* Therefore, citizens should create knowledge independently and bring practical and local knowledge into the traditionally oriented scientific community through their external perspective
