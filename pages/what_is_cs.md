# What is Citizen Science

* The term citizen science was coined by Alan Irwin and Rick Bonney independently of each other 
* Both used the term but give it different meanings. 

## Alan Irwin (Irwin 1995)
* Citizen science is a way for democratizing science, which he regards as elitist
* Science seen as obligation to take care of the needs of people (= citizens)
* Therefore, citizens should create knowledge independently and bring practical and local knowledge into the traditionally oriented scientific community through their external perspective




Citizen science is often understood as an alternative approach to generating knowledge at the interface of science, society and politics. We understand Citizen Science as a form of integration of expertise and participation in scientific processes by people who are not necessarily bound to an academic institution. In a two-year process, dialogue forums and expert discussions were held throughout Germany to discuss the potentials, opportunities and challenges of Citizen Science. The results are presented here (Richter et al.).
