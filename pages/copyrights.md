# Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights in Citizen Sciene

All aspects connected with copyright issues are governed by the German Act on Copyright and Related Rights  (Urheberrechtsgesetz – UrhG <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/index.html"> https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/index.html</>). The copyright (in German: Urheberrecht) belongs to the intellectual property rights. 

In addition to copyright law, intellectual property law includes industrial property rights, e.g. patent and design law or trademark law. In general language use and in national and international legal relations, intellectual property law is also referred to as "Intellectual Property" (Wandtke 2019a).  
In §7 of the UrhG the authorship (in German: Urheberschaft) is defined as “Author (in German: Urheber) is the creator of the work (in German: Werk)”.  
What can be regarded as a work is defined in §2 section 1 of the UrhG:  

“The protected works of literature, science and art include in particular
<ol type ="1">
<li> linguistic works, such as written works, speeches and computer programs;</li>
<li> works of music;</li>
<li> pantomime works, including works of the art of dance;</li>
<li> works of the visual arts, including works of architecture and applied arts, and drafts of such works; photographic works, including works created in a similar way to photographic works;</li>
<li> cinematographic works, including works created in a similar way to cinematographic works;</li>
<li> representations of a scientific or technical nature, such as drawings, plans, maps, sketches, tables and sculptures.”</li>
</ol>
  
And section 2 of §2 UrhG states: “Works within the meaning of this Act are only personal intellectual creations.”  

This means that a work requires human creation (in German: menschliches Schaffen) and for other human beings, the intellectual content of a work must be perceivable in a distinct shape (in German: wahrnehmbare konkreten Formgebung).  
In contrast, scientific works are characterized by fundamental peculiarities which are the essence of a scientific work. A scientific discourse on the content of a scientific statement, teaching or theory must be possible at its core without the authors being allowed to take copyright action against the entire discourse or against individual criticism. This scientific content is therefore to be classified as in the public domain, at least as far as the moral rights (in German: Urheberpersönlichkeitsrecht) of the author are not affected (Geibel 2017).  
The moral rights of the author are regulated in §§ 12 to 14 of the UrhG. According to these, the author alone may determine whether and how his work is published (§12). He also has a right to be named (§13) (Otto et al. 2017) <a href="https://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/digitales/persoenlichkeitsrechte/244852/urheberpersoenlichkeitsrecht"> - https://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/digitales/persoenlichkeitsrechte/244852/urheberpersoenlichkeitsrecht</>.
