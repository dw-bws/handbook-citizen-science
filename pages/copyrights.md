# Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights in Citizen Sciene

All aspects connected with copyright issues are governed by the German Act on Copyright and Related Rights  (Urheberrechtsgesetz – UrhG). The copyright (in German: Urheberrecht) belongs to the intellectual property rights. 

In addition to copyright law, intellectual property law includes industrial property rights, e.g. patent and design law or trademark law. In general language use and in national and international legal relations, intellectual property law is also referred to as "Intellectual Property" (Wandtke 2019a).  
In §7 of the UrhG the authorship (in German: Urheberschaft) is defined as “Author (in German: Urheber) is the creator of the work (in German: Werk)”.  
What can be regarded as a work is defined in §2 section 1 of the UrhG:  

“The protected works of literature, science and art include in particular
<ol type ="1">
<li> linguistic works, such as written works, speeches and computer programs;</li>
<li> works of music;</li>
<li> pantomime works, including works of the art of dance;</li>
<li> works of the visual arts, including works of architecture and applied arts, and drafts of such works; photographic works, including works created in a similar way to photographic works;</li>
<li> cinematographic works, including works created in a similar way to cinematographic works;</li>
<li> representations of a scientific or technical nature, such as drawings, plans, maps, sketches, tables and sculptures.”</li>
